				<h2>Childhood Wonder</h2>
				<p>My first experiences with writing weren’t actually digital. Which is more than likely the norm. I doubt many people jump straight to reading and writing on digital devices. My first experience with writing, like most people, was writing short stories for class in kindergarten. The most memorable one being some silly story about Dancer being the best reindeer because he could cheer up anyone with his dancing. I remember it was in one of those flimsy paper cover notebooks, the ones with the flimsy black plastic binding.
				<br><br>
				It somehow managed to stand the test of time because I ended up finding it when I was going through my things to move out of my mom’s. I couldn’t help but grin at the terrible handwriting, but I guess I should count it a win that it was legible. Still, it was a real story. Somehow, without even knowing what a plot or what a writing process was, I had managed to write a short story with a beginning, middle, and end. I was probably 5 when I wrote it and I feel like I might have had a better understanding of story writing then than I do now.</p>

				<h2>Microsoft Word FTW</h2>
				<p>Digitally, my journey probably started on the family computer after my mom moved us in with her fiance when I was 7 or 8. I hadn’t had a computer at home before, so it took a while before I actually started using it. Though, my mom’s fiance had a computer that he played an MMO on most days, so I was relegated to whatever applications and games I could find that didn’t use internet. Thus my discovery of Microsoft Word. It was like a shiny new toy that I could write all of my stories on. Most of them were riffs of other things I’d seen or read – lots of half-hearted fanfiction. I loved giving each character’s dialogue a different font style or a different color, and it was fun to find images of “my characters” and paste them into the document too. The point wasn’t to write fully fleshed out or complete stories. There was no point. I was just having fun and learning that technology could take what I had inside my head and elevate it.</p>

				<h2>Nightdreaming</h2>
				<p>It was another few years before I actually started playing with original elements and storylines. But until then, I was just daydreaming and scribbling half-baked ideas into the margins of my notebook during class. I started to develop insomnia around this age but I wasn’t allowed to make any noise or turn on any lights, lest I wanted to summon the Monster. So, I would lay there at night daydreaming (nightdreaming?) and creating stories in the hopes that it would lull me to sleep. Did it work? Yeah, not really. I was usually exhausted the next day and would go to school only to submit terrible papers because my head was just too full of fairytales and nightdreams.</p>

				<h2>Inspired By...</h2>
				<p>At some point in the next 5 years, I underwent a new evolution in my writing. Or at least what got me to write. I don’t remember the exact moment it happened, or what specific song brought me this revelation, but I started listening to music at every waking moment. I summoned the Monster almost nightly because I just didn’t want to turn off my radio. It occurred to me that songs are like stories and as soon as I realized this, I started to visualize the stories that songs were telling. Hearing a song with a story I liked, being able to visualize a cool scene from it, made me want to build more of the world around this one scene. I’m not sure if it was a desire to ‘complete’ the vision, similar to when you get a single line in a song stuck in your head and it’s because your mind is trying to fill in the gaps and finish the song.</p>

				<h2>The Slump</h2>
				<p>Shortly after turning 18, I fell into a writing slump. All of the technology in the world couldn’t have helped me. I can’t even say that I was struggling to write because I was working. Everything that was preventing me from finding satisfaction in writing was in my head. It was the mentality of that saying from the bible about putting away childish things. In my head, everyone wanted to be an author and I told myself that with so many authors out there, being one myself wouldn’t be a viable career. I needed something that put money in my pocket. My friends were all out in the workforce, doing blue collar jobs and retail and finding partners or starting families. I thought that was what I was supposed to do too.
				<br><br>
				I tried to give up on writing. I kept it on the side as a hobby. A guilty pleasure that brought me more shame than pleasure. I didn’t write anything original. There was no point if it would never see the light of day. So, I wrote fanfiction and felt disgusting when people would sneer at me if I mentioned it.</p>

				<h2>Why Not?</h2>
				<p>Recently, I finally decided that I had been doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. My bachelor’s degree wasn’t helping me to find work, and I couldn’t keep working retail. There’s nothing wrong with being a cashier, but it just isn’t enough for me. I need something to think about, something to wrestle with, something like, well… writing. Anytime I have a free moment at work or while going about my day, I take the time to write something. In a notebook, on a scrap of paper, a random note on my phone, the medium didn’t matter so much as getting it down somewhere was. Then I get home and transfer all of my handwritten notes and narratives and thoughts to a Google Doc. On my days off, I sit at my computer for hours with headphones on, just writing and writing. Usually half-baked ideas, but I’ve stopped seeing them as failed projects. Just because I didn’t finish them, doesn’t mean I don’t get anything out of it.
				<br><br>
				I feel better when I write. Even if it was only a couple-hundred words, it’s a couple-hundred words more that I’ve written. It’s practice and stress-relief. I came back to school for the English program, for the Rhetoric and Writing Master’s, because I finally asked myself why I can’t be a writer professionally. Because the field is competitive? So are most fields. Because I’m not good enough? I only have to read some of the un-edited self-published works on Amazon to know that I can write at least as good as any of them. So, why not write for a living?</p>
