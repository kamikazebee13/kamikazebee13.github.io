		<h2>Profile: Paul Castle</h2>
		<img src="imgs/MatthewandPaul.webp">
		<p>Some might recognize Paul Castle from his works: "Pringle & Finn", "The Secret Ingredient", and "Adoroscopes". Though legally blind and having lost over 90% of his vision, Paul Castle is still making his dreams of being an author and <a class="inTextLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5tuyOXQDs">illustrator</a> come true.</p>
		<p>Paul shares a <a class="inTextLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MatthewandPaulOfficial">YouTube channel</a> with his fully sighted husband, <a class="inTextLink" href="https://paulcastlestudio.com/pages/about">Matthew Castle</a>. The pair of them take a lighthearted approach to normalizing disabilities through a series of videos with the premise of, "Pranking my blind husband".</p>
		<p>Their channel primarily focuses on Paul's disability, but that doesn't mean that they don't advocate for diversity. Paul said in an <a class="inTextLink" href="https://www.pinereadsreview.com/blog/interview-with-paul-castle/">interview</a> that he technically wrote his first children's book at the age of 6, but his first published work, titled <a class="inTextLink" href="https://paulcastlestudio.com/products/the-pengrooms-childrens-book">"Pringle & Finn"</a>, was released in 2022. This is a lighthearted children's book about a pair of male penguins delivering wedding cakes and overcoming challenges at each of the weddings they visit.</p>

		<p>Paul ran into some trouble when he was attempting to get his second book, <a class="inTextLink" href="https://paulcastlestudio.com/products/the-secret-ingredient">"The Secret Ingredient"</a>, out to stores. His second book was a direct sequel to "Pringle & Finn" where the duo continue delivering cakes, but to birthday parties this time. They visit a variety of different families before being rewarded at the end with a baby penguin of their own. A bookstore, that Paul has decided to leave anonymous for safety reasons, purchased about 100 copies of "The Secret Ingredient" only to then return the books.</p>

		<p>Paul shared to YouTube part of the call with the store's manager where they explained that they were unable to carry the book in their stores. The person who had initially placed the order for Paul's book had, according to the store manager, been unaware of the store's policies. Not much more was explained aside from that. It isn't stated exactly what policy was violated when the book order was placed, or if there might potentially be another reason for them to return the books. Paul's book signing event with the store, which was the reason for the large quantity of books, was also subsequently canceled.</p>

		<p>"The Secret Ingredient" doesn't appear on any official banned book lists, meaning that this wasn't an official book ban. However, Paul explains in another <a class="inTextLink" href="https://glaad.org/representation-the-secret-ingredient-to-acceptance/">interview with Gladd.org</a> that his book was already on the shelves when the bookstore pulled them to be returned. He told his interviewer, "[T]his constitutes as a ban, because banning includes school reading lists, libraries, and bookstore shelves."</p>

		<p>Whether it's a bookstore rejecting the book, or an official ban, these actions can be devestating. Not just for the author, but also for the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. These rejections and bans are a way of trying to invalidate the existence of people who don't conform to the idea of the "traditional couple".</p>

		<p>Continug to allow such wide spread banning like this is also dangerous in a general sense. All it takes is a handful complains about a single book to have it removed from the shelves of a library or bookstore. With that in mind, what's to stop the removal of reference books or history books that don't align with the ideology of just a handful of people?</p>

		<p>Book bans stifle, and attempt to smother, ideas and the spread of information.</p>

		<p>In Paul's case, his community was able to rally around him and 	either purchase a copy of "The Secret Ingredient" for themselves, or helped to get Paul's book into other bookstores. While this was helpful in Paul's specific situation, the ALA outlines other ways that readers can get involved in prevent book bans. Some of these involve attending events surrounding Banned Books Week, or posting to social media with the #LetFreedomReadDay or #BannedBooksWeek tags. They also suggest that you reach out by penning a letter to a favorite banned or challenged author to show them your support.</p>
